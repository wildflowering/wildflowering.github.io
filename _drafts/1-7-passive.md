The passive voice is used to emphasise the <span style="color:#E91D63">action or process</span> of a sentence instead of the agent; it's not important who does something but rather <span style="color:#E91D63">what</span> is done.

+ Bob baut ein Haus. <- active
+ Ein Haus wird von Bob gebaut. <span style="color:#E91D63"><- passive</span>
<br/>

#### Forming the Passive
In the passive voice, the direct object turns into the object, therefore taking the nominative case. The verb is replaced by the correct conjugation of "werden" and a past participle of the original verb.

</p> Note the subject of the active voice disappears completely; this usually occurs in the passive voice.

#### Stating the Agent
If you need to state the agent, a <span style="color:#E91D63">prepositional phrase</span> can be used. In German, there are two prepositions you can use to do this:

+ von (if the agent is a person)
+ durch (if the agent is an inanimate object)
<br/>

<br/>
<center>e.g.  Ich werde <span style="color:#E91D63">von Bob</span> gek√ºsst.</center>
