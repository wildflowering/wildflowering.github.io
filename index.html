    <h1>hi :)</h1>
    <p>idk if you'll ever see this because qr codes are annoying as SHIT but if you do i jus' wanna thank you for being such an awesome person!</p>
    <p>ik i probably ain't the numero uno person you've talked to this year but it's been really cool getting to know you for another business year :) and even though i'm probably not the nicest person to you most of the time i do genuinely root for you and all the cool things that you're gonna get up to, here's to another long epic business year (wow did you see that that was repetition that was so cool i'm like no. 1 english)</p>
    <br>
    <p>probably not on the level of 40 diabetes inducing candy canes but i tried my best!!</p>
    <p>keep it cool space captain :some_emoji_that_pertains_to_these_messages</p>
