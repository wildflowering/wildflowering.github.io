    <img src="../imgs/churro_bundt_cake.jpg" alt="Churro Bundt Cake" height="300">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The churro bundt cake draws inspiration from the traditional Spanish and Mexican churro, a fried dough pastry rolled in cinnamon sugar, reimagined as a cake typically baked in a bundt pan for a delightful twist on the beloved treat.</p>
    <p><i>This cinnamon-flavored churro Bundt cake is topped with dulce de lecheâ€” a truly stunning dessert.</i></p>
